                Hi there! I'm a machine learning research engineer focused on building AI that's both, useful and safe. 
                I work at the intersection of applied ML engineering, fairness research, and AI alignment understanding. 
                With over 5 years of experience in the field of applied AI research, I am passionate about solving the practical problems of today with an emphasis on designing systems that align with human values and have a long-term positive impact, while thinking carefully about the superintelligent systems we may rely on tomorrow.         
                I believe that diverse perspectives are crucial to building effective, ethical, and safe superintelligent systems.

            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    I'm a Machine Learning Research Engineer with expertise in developing and deploying cutting-edge AI systems responsibly. 
                    My work focuses on using AI to solve challenging problems while ensuring alignment with human values and ethics. 
                    I believe that the future of humanity is deeply intertwined with the development of safe superintelligence systems that can augment our capabilities without compromising our core values.
                    To me, this means prioritizing using AI to solve problems that matter most to people today, while continuing to ask the hard questions about how we can ensure that superintelligence is safe, emotionally intelligent, ethically aligned and fair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold an M.S. in computer science from The University of Texas at Austin, with a minor in computational linguistics and an NSF-certified portfolio in ethical AI. 
                    My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied machine learning, allowing me to tackle complex challenges effectively.
                    <b>I am currently an ML research engineer at Zacks Investment Research,</b> where I collaborate with a diverse team of talented people to push the boundaries of generative AI in finance.
                    I endeavor to contribute to the AI research community through publications that span fairness in AI, emotional intelligence in AI, interpretability, and alignment strategies for large language models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not immersed in research, you can find me listening to a good podcast, writing for my blog, or watching the latest hit series on Netflix!

            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f7f7f7 0%, #ffffff 100%); padding: 2.5rem; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 2.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #b76e79; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);">
                <p style="color: #4a5568; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                    Ever since I was a child, I deeply believed in the power of language, technology and science to transform lives. 
                    Growing up, I grappled with whether I wanted to be a writer, an engineer, or a scientist.
                    It wasn't until I discovered the field of natural language processing during my undergraduate, that I realized I could combine all three passions into a single career.              
                </p>
                <p style="color: #4a5568; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                    My journey into the world of AI began with baby steps. As time passed, I became increasingly interested in the ethical implications of AI systems and the importance of building models that are not only powerful but also aligned with human values.
                    My research started out focused on fairness and safety, spanning topics like sexism detection, threat detection using NLP, and multimodal misogyny detection in memes. 
                    Over time, I began to realize that the real problem was not just the visibe biases in models, but the underlying misalignment between AI objectives and human values.
                    I also realised that any technology is only as good as the challenges it can solve effectively in high stake domains, and so I expanded my professional focus to applied ML engineering for finance.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #4a5568; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">
                    These experiences shaped a clear mission for my work: to build AI systems that are not only intelligent, but emotionally aware, interpretable, and aligned with human intent. 
                    I believe that the superintelligence without emotional intelligence risks amplifying harm rather than insight, and that interpretability is essential for ensuring safety, accountability, and trust. 
                    Equally important, AI must move beyond theoretical benchmarks to solve real problems at scale, particularly in high-stakes domains (like finance!). 
                    Rooted in the firm belief that technology without intentional inclusion is just sophisticated discrimination, my approach centers on developing safe, fair systems that solve real-world problems.
                </p>

                    My perspective is shaped by both privilege and responsibility. I am the first woman in my family to pursue a career, made possible by parents who believe deeply in equality and consistently support my ambitions. 
                    I am especially conscious that I stand on opportunities my mother sacrificed, and that awareness informs a core principle of my work: technology must not compound harm for underprivileged or historically excluded communities. 
                    I am a strong advocate for women in STEM and for gender equity in education and professional spaces, not as an abstract ideal but as a necessary condition for building better systems. 
                    My father’s career in technology was a defining influence, instilling both technical curiosity and a respect for disciplined engineering. 
                    In a field moving at unprecedented speed, I hope my work contributes to a more deliberate trajectory: one where progress toward superintelligence is matched by interpretability, emotional awareness, and a commitment to fairness and safety, and where others are inspired to build not just faster systems, but more responsible ones.

            <h3>Research Interests</h3>
            <div class="about-content" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
                <p>
                    My research focuses on safe superintelligence from an ethical and applied perspective. 
                    I aim to contribute to the larger understanding of how we can build AI systems that can not only effectively solve problems in high stake domains, but is also aligned with human values, emotionally intelligent, interpretable, and capable of solving real-world problems effectively. 
                    I'm particularly interested in the following broad topics: 
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li><strong>The intersection of alignment and interpretability in large language models: </strong>
                        Investigating how interpretability techniques can be used to understand, evaluate, and improve alignment in large language models, with an emphasis on making internal representations, objectives, and failure modes transparent for safe deployment.</li>
                        
                    <li><strong>The role of emotions in safe superintelligence: </strong>
                        Studying emotional intelligence as a component of alignment, including how modeling affect, intent, and social context can contribute to safer behavior, reduced harm, and more human-aligned decision-making in advanced AI systems.</li>
                        
                    <li><strong>Equifinality, evolution, and evaluating intelligence in AI: </strong>
                        Examining how different architectures, training regimes, and objectives converge to similar psychological/neurological phenomena in different models and humans, and what this implies for defining, measuring, and stress-testing intelligence beyond narrow benchmark performance.</li>
                        
                    <li><strong>Fairness and bias identification and mitigation in AI systems: </strong>
                        Developing methods to detect, analyze, and mitigate bias in language and multimodal models, with a focus on scalable, deployment-ready approaches that promote fairness without compromising system performance.</li>                            
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    I believe that addressing these topics is crucial for ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed in ways that align with human values and societal well-being.
                    That said, I am also deeply committed to applied research that solves real problems effectively in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and education.
                    If any of these areas resonate with you, please feel free to reach out! 
                    I'd love to connect with fellow researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts who share a passion for building safe, fair, and impactful AI systems.

                <p>
                    In this paper, we investigate the presence of socioeconomic bias in large language models. 
                    To this end, we introduce a novel dataset "SILVERSPOON", consisting of 12000 samples that provide a multifaceted analysis of this complex issue.  
                    We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset and find that models exhibit implicit and explicit socioeconomic bias. 
                    This is further augmented by stereotypes emanating from a combination of gender bias and racial bias. .

                    In this work, we propose "DeepSoftDebias", an algorithm that uses a neural network to perform ‘soft debiasing’.
                    We exhaustively evaluate this algorithm across a variety of state-of-theart datasets, accuracy metrics, and challenging NLP tasks. 
                    We find that DeepSoftDebias outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at reducing bias across gender, race, and religion.

                <h3>Language Models (Mostly) Do Not Consider Emotion Triggers When Predicting Emotion</h3>
                <div class="card-meta">Smriti Singh, Cornelia Caragea, Junyi Jessy Li| NAACL| 2024</div>
                <p>
                    Situations and events evoke emotions in humans, but to what extent do they inform the prediction of emotion detection models? 
                    This work investigates how well human-annotated emotion triggers correlate with features that models deemed salient in their prediction of emotions.
                    Our analysis reveals that emotion triggers are largely not considered salient features for emotion prediction models, instead there is intricate interplay between various features and the task of emotion detection.
